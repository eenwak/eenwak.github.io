headline: As a member of the iOS development team on this project, I worked on developing and customizing multiple versions of this app for different clients
description: Safe Site is an immersive safety application used to perform safety audits and pre-start safety assessments for field workers, plant staff and safety inspectors.

The app allows users to take photos of their working environment and to identify safety risks by annotating these photos with risk stickers and drawing tools. 

These annotations are stored for audit purposes and are used to generate reports summarizing the risks and the controls that need to be implemented to address them.
