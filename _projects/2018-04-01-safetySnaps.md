**Safety Snaps** is an app designed by Bourne Digital for their clients to simplify the process of raising a safety hazard in the workplace and/or creating maintenance requests for faulty equipment.

I worked both on making the design more iOS friendly and developing the app to use native iOS features such as **Text to Speech**, **Location Services** and **Core ML**.
