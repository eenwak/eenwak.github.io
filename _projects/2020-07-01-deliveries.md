##### Offline
The app allows the drivers to process their deliveries even when they don't have internet connexion and syncs those operations back to the server once the device is online.

##### Smart Delivery Dockets
The app automatically generates delivery dockets containing all the relevant information about each delivery (calculated quantities, client's signature, GPS coordinates...)
