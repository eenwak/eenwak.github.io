description: An app using Bluetooth and iBeacon technologies to improve COVID-19 contact tracing protocols.

This app uses iBeacons to trace which employees come into contact with which during their work hours and while they're on their work premises (using geofencing).

This information is used to alert anyone who may have come into contact with an employee who tests positive to COVID-19 in order to implement isolation procedures and prevent further spread of the virus.
